Requirements:
	- ROOT 4.xx or later, recent g++ (not tested before 3.2.xx)

Optional package :
	- Pythia 6

Tested environments :
	- Linux
	- Windows/Cygwin
	- Mac OS X

** Version 1.3.5 (30/06/2016)
	Fixed a bug in the MadX output files parser preventing long beamlines
	(>40 elements) to be manipulated properly.
	Added the capability to leave multiple fields unretrieved in the parsing
	of these MadX outputs.
	New features :
		Added Pythia8 as an extra tool to generate single diffractive events
		for their propagation into the beamline(s)

** Version 1.3.4 (patch1) ** 25/11/2015
	Collision centre of mass energy is now 13 TeV
	Added a printout for this centre of mass energy
	New features :
		- field strengths are now editable outside H_OpticalElement

** Version 1.3.4 ** 07/05/2009
        Extension of the CMSSW-dedicated release (namely 1.3.3)
        New features: removing useless stuffs for CMSSW
	  - remove all routines
	  - removing all instances of TGraph, TGraphErrors, TCanvas

** Version 1.3.3 ** 24/02/2009
	In parallel to recent developments (now 1_5_2 is out), this version has been released
	for the needs of CMSSW.
	New features :
		- interface to external TRandom* calls in H_BeamParticle smearing functions


** Version 1.3 ** 09/01/2007
	New features :
		- Bug removal in kicker implementation. Now the kick is done in the middle of the kicker. 
		  Hector is now compatible with MAD-X within 0.05 µm in the positioning of beamline protons.
		- H_BeamLine::getIPProperties()

** Version 1.2 ** 14/12/2006
	New features :
		- new revision of the Makefile. Allows the compilation of any routine file containing a 'main(...)' function.
		  e.g. for "routines/test.cpp", use "make test".
		  Builds the tarball of the sources using "make tar".
		  Can be now easily adapted for Mac OS X
		- update of the transport matrices. Weak field of rectangular dipoles added.
		

** Version 1.1 ** before :)
	New features :
		- Bug removal in chromaticity correction for quadrupoles
		- propagation of non-proton particles
		- "_RELATIVE_ENERGY_ and _ENERGY_SDIP_ #defines" are replaced by "extern bool relative_energy"


** Version 1.0 ** before :)
